to detect all major CORS header misconfigurations, explained clearly without using code examples:

1. Wildcard Origin with Credentials
Misconfiguration: The server allows all origins (*) while also enabling credentials (cookies, HTTP auth).

Logic to detect: Check if Access-Control-Allow-Origin is * and Access-Control-Allow-Credentials is true. This combination is invalid and insecure because credentials should only be allowed for specific origins.

2. Origin Reflection Without Validation
Misconfiguration: The server reflects the Origin request header back in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header without proper validation.

Logic to detect: Send requests from multiple different origins and observe if the response always matches the origin sent. If so, it's likely reflecting origin dynamically, which is exploitable.

3. Wildcard in Headers or Methods
Misconfiguration: The server uses * in Access-Control-Allow-Headers or Access-Control-Allow-Methods.

Logic to detect: Inspect these headers in preflight responses (OPTIONS). If wildcards are used, it may allow unsafe client behavior (e.g., sending Authorization headers or using unsafe methods like PUT, DELETE).

4. Allowing null Origin
Misconfiguration: The server explicitly allows the null origin, which can be abused from sandboxed iframes or local files.

Logic to detect: Check if Access-Control-Allow-Origin equals null in the response when the Origin header is set to null.

5. Allowing Private or Localhost Origins
Misconfiguration: The server accepts origins that resolve to localhost or private IP ranges (e.g., 127.0.0.1, 192.168.x.x).

Logic to detect: Attempt requests with such origins and see if they are accepted in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.

6. Missing Vary: Origin Header for Dynamic Origin Handling
Misconfiguration: When a server allows different origins dynamically, it must include a Vary: Origin response header to prevent cache poisoning.

Logic to detect: If the server returns different Access-Control-Allow-Origin values for different requests but does not include Vary: Origin, itâ€™s misconfigured.

7. Overly Permissive Preflight Response
Misconfiguration: The server responds positively to preflight requests with minimal or no validation.

Logic to detect: Send preflight requests with uncommon or risky headers and methods. If the server allows them all, it's too permissive.

8. Improper Use of Multiple CORS Headers
Misconfiguration: The server sends multiple Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers or malformed combinations of headers.

Logic to detect: Check for duplicate or conflicting CORS headers in the response, which can confuse browsers or bypass security controls.

9. Inconsistent CORS Policy Across Routes
Misconfiguration: Some endpoints enforce CORS restrictions correctly, while others don't.

Logic to detect: Evaluate CORS behavior across various routes of the application. If inconsistency is found, it indicates poor or incomplete policy enforcement.
